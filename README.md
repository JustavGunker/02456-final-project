This is the repository for the final project in DTU course 02456 Deep Learning. 



**Notebooks**

Notebooks for recreating our results can be found [here](Model/Notebooks). 

The semi-supervised models have been trained on DTU's HPC cluster on thus load our [pre-trained models](Trained_models), to produce results. 

Baseline U-Net with and without data augmentation is combined in the same [notebook](Model/Notebooks/Baseline_UNet.ipynb). They can be run and trained within reasonable time on CPU, to produce results. Alternatively they also have [pre-trained models](Trained_models).


**Scripts**

Scripts have been used for all semi-supervised models, to perform the training on the HPC. Scripts can be found [here](Model).
