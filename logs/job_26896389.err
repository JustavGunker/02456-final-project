/zhome/d2/4/167803/Desktop/Deep_project/02456-final-project/func/utill.py:47: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`). Consider using `matplotlib.pyplot.close()`.
  fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(20, 5))
